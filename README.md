# Koch Snowflake fractal generator

This is just a fun project that grew out of a code challenge night.  The first goal here was to create a function that could draw an equilateral triangle of any size at any angle.  Then I was going to try to work out a way to chain the calls so triangles will be drawn on every available triangle side.

Working out how to draw on the canvas element as well as getting back into some trigonometry (rememeber "sohcahtoa"?) has been part of the fun here.

[Here's a quick black&white animation][jkio1] based on what I've done so far. Also, [here's one with more color][jkio2].
